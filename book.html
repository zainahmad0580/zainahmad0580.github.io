                                such as dealing with emotions, setting boundaries,

                            <p>The author emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding in parenting. 
                                She encourages parents to view their children as individuals with their own 
                                thoughts, feelings, and perspectives, rather than as extensions of themselves. 
                                This approach can help parents develop stronger, more meaningful relationships 
                                with their children.
